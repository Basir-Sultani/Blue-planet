                <h2>The challenge- Human exploitation</h2>
                <p class="leftBorder">The greatest challenge facing humanity today,  I would say,  is exploitation of a group of people by other groups of people.</p>
                <p>
                    It is I believe one of the most pressing problems today. Daily in the world we see people working hard, e.g. the domestic worker, the farm worker, the factory worker and so on. They leave home before we even get up from our beds, they walk and commute long distances to get to work because they do not have their own cars and in most cases they live far from their work places. Their work is hard and farm workers work in all weathers. Yet they earn a miniscule percentage of what we earn, and are treated as “second class citizens”. They are the working poor, they are not unemployed yet they have very little money to be able to live a comfortable life. Importantly they are not counted in the statistics of the poor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The story of such exploitation of one group of people by another group of people, is an old problem plaguing humanity. Exploitation has taken many different shapes, e.g. patriarchy, serfdom, slavery, indentured labour, colonisation of indigenous people forcing them to work, taxing people so that they have to work to access money so that they can pay taxes, forcing prisoners to work on farms or on building roads and now we have sweated labour and bonded labour.  The common feature is that society is divided into ethnic groups and the one ethnic group exercises its authority over the other.  The authority is derived from various power relationships spanning over centuries of oppression of one form or another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why do they choose to work in these conditions? Is it because work gives them dignity; is it that they need to be occupied; are they lazy and so can only access these kinds of jobs; is society doing them a favour by offering them these jobs? These are important questions that economists should ask in order to understand whether these people have a choice at all. In my view all this is possible where large sections of communities live in poverty and it is the poverty which compels them to take on any job and to accept the exploitation as there is no other alternative. They have no choice. They live between starvation and exploitation but are not counted as the poor (Sen, n.d.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our society today is more unequal than ever before. The poor get poorer and the rich get richer. Within this situation we do have many ills such as violence, crime, corruption, drugs and countless other problems which many people would see as the biggest challenge but digging deeper into causes rather than looking at the symptoms we see that all this arises from exploitation and poverty, it is part of a system that we are perpetuating.

                    Exploitation an appendage of capitalism and neo liberalism
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This situation is created by the capitalist system which <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/kimberly-amadeo-3305455" > Kimberly Amadeo</a>, President of world money watch and author of a number of books on the economy defines as, “Capitalism is an economic system where private entities own the factors of production. The four factors are entrepreneurship, capital goods, natural resources, and labor. The owners of capital goods, natural resources, and entrepreneurship exercise control through companies. The individual owns his or her labor. The only exception would be slavery, where it is owned by another individual or a company.”[1]
                </p>
                <p>
                    In more recent times towards the end of the 20th century, capitalism was replaced by neo liberalism which is defined as “Neoliberalism replaced modernisation theory as the official approach to development in the 1980s. It focuses on economic policies and institutions which are seen as holding back development because they limit the free market. The agreement by the World Bank and IMF that neoliberal policies were the best path to development is referred to as the Washington Consensus following a meeting in Washington by world leaders in 1989.” [2]

                    This results in the situation where governments enable these businesses to earn a maximum profit with very little obligation to give back, because the captured Governments make laws which keep the taxes for these companies at a reduced level because they want the industries to flourish. Their reasoning is that these companies offer employment to jobless people and enrich the country through their “investment”.
